      I'm a tall-ish gent who grew up avoiding parties on the beaches of NJ. My father installed carpet, and I grew up helping him. Throughout high school I delivered pizza, picked up roofing and landscaping jobs, and worked at a gourmet deli for a hot second.

      I arrived at RIT in year 2000. Started a degree in

      </a>
      {' '}
      (a true BS), then moved to IT w/New Media, then an MS in IT (w/a focus on client-server apps). Here, a band of awesome professors had us tinkering with multi-player browser games, cross-browser SVG, and XMLHttpRequests before jQuery existed (though

      My first full-time web development job was a co-op the summer of 2003.

      After college, I joined a corporate newspaper conglomerate (GateHouse Media), and got into Python ðŸ™Œ and Drupal ðŸ˜­. There I also met two of the best and longest influences on me,

      and

      . Thanks, guys.

      I found my way over to Boston after that, and
